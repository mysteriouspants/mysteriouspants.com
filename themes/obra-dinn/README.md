## Obra Dinn

A minimalist [Zola][zola] theme based on the 1-bit color design of [*The Return of the Obra Dinn*][obdn], with layout (loosely) based on the [Kactus][kact] theme for Jekyll.

## Modification/Licensing

I want you to be able to use this software regardless of who you may be, what you are working on, or the environment in which you are working on it - I hope you'll use it for good and not evil! To this end, "Obra Dinn" is licensed under the [2-clause BSD][2cbsd] license, with other licenses available by request. Happy coding!

*Note: if you disentangle my personal branding from this theme I'd be extremely interested in putting this into its own repo and take a PR! I'd do it myself but it's not a huge priority for me right now.*
