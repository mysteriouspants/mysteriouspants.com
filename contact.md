Should you need to contact me for any reason (questions, corrections,
redactions, contractions, or perhaps just to chat), perhaps stop by
`irc.freenode.net` and whisper `mysteriouspants`. I use a bouncer that
is always on, so I'll see it eventually.

By far the most reliable means of connecting, however, is to raise an
issue on this site's [Github repo][gh].
